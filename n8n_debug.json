Michael Geiger is speaking on Monday, January 20th to show how to move past one-off prompts and orchestrate agents like Claude Code and Gas Town through real production workflows. This is for software teams ready to ship better code by applying human judgment where it actually matters.\n\nMichael will demonstrate structured workflows covering research to align intent, planning stages, parallel implementation, and early breaking techniques. You'll see where human judgment creates the most value in agent-assisted development.\n\nThe session shows how to focus on high-leverage decisions like defining quality standards and setting constraints upfront, rather than spending time cleaning up generated code. Michael shares a practical checklist you can use immediately to identify workflow and environment gaps, helping your team ship higher-quality software faster without getting stuck in agent babysitting mode.\n\nReserve your spot at https://www.meetup.com/columbus-ai/events/312833823/?slug=columbus-ai&eventId=312833823 and join Michael on Monday, January 20th.

We use specialized agent teams instead. Counterintuitively, this produces way better results. Here's the architecture that changed everything 🧵\n\n---\n\nOur first attempt failed spectacularly. One agent tried to juggle subject lines, hooks, content, and CTAs all at once. The output felt robotic and generic. Quality was all over the place. Then we realized the problem wasn't the AI. It was asking it to do too much.\n\n---\n\nWe rebuilt it as a team sport. 4 specialist agents work in parallel, each mastering one thing. A 5th agent acts as senior editor, reviewing for coherence and polish. Division of labor + quality control = consistently better output.\n\n---\n\nResults were immediate. Emails that took 3-5 hours now take seconds. We built it as a sub-workflow that's usable across different processes. Quality stays consistently high without manual review. That 5th agent catches what the specialists miss.\n\n---\n\nThe takeaway is to stop asking one AI to be a generalist. Deploy specialists and add a critic for quality control. This pattern works for content, data processing, customer support, anywhere quality matters. #AIAutomation #WorkflowDesign","platform":"x (thread) - case study","type":"post","status":"published","date":"2026-01-07T15:20:00.000-05:00"},{"id":"2e0281f6-37cf-812c-a6f0-e8477e3aef08","title":"Tired of generic AI responses?
